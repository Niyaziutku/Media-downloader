# Media Downloader

it **downloads media**.

- Supported formats:
  **MP4, WEBM, MP3, WAV, FLAC**

It *should* work on other platforms too,  
but for non-YouTube sites you may need to **log in via your default browser**.

## About this project (honest part)
This project was built in about **4 hours** using **AI assistance**  
by a developer who:
- has **almost no coding background**

- still somehow made it work 😄

So yes —  
there **may be bugs**,  
but overall it **does what it’s supposed to do**.

## Language support
The app supports **9 languages**:
- Turkish
- English
- German
- Spanish
- French

If you find bugs or something doesn’t work:

- or just complain politely 😅

I’ll try to fix problems when I can.

- ⏳ **Windows** — planned
- ❌ **macOS** — not planned until someone knowledgeable helps

Built for fun.  
Surprisingly usable.
